# Project Progress Report

## Date: April 2nd, 2024

### Overview:
The objective of this project is to develop an AI model capable of predicting gender and age based on facial data.

### Updates:
Gabriel has outlined plans to enhance the project's testing accuracy by refactoring a portion of the codebase. Initially employing techniques such as Eigen Decomposition, Singular Value Decomposition, Linear Regression, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Gabriel intends to explore additional methods to optimize testing accuracy.

### Achievements:
While the project's initial state was not inadequate, Gabriel recognizes opportunities for refinement, unlike some previous projects requiring extensive overhaul.

### Challenges:
The primary challenge lies in acquiring publicly available facial data. The current dataset exhibits suboptimal performance during training and validation, possibly attributed to algorithmic shortcomings.

### Next Steps:
Moving forward, the codebase will be utilized to train smaller batches of facial data, ensuring mitigation of common issues such as overfitting and underfitting.

### Action Items:
1. Evaluate alternative techniques, including ensemble methods and advanced deep learning architectures, to improve testing accuracy.
2. Continuously seek additional sources of publicly available facial data to augment the existing dataset (Gabriel and team, ongoing).
3. Implement data preprocessing techniques to refine the quality of training and validation datasets (Gabriel, by April 15th).

### Conclusion:
While progress has been made, challenges persist in achieving the desired testing accuracy. The decision to refine the codebase demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing these challenges and enhancing project performance. Ongoing experimentation with diverse techniques and datasets is paramount to realizing success in training an AI model for gender and age prediction based on facial data. With steadfast dedication, we remain optimistic about achieving our project objectives.
