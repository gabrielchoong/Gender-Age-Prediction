1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gabrielchoonggeliang/Gender-Age-Prediction.git
   ```
1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can check the list of dependencies in the Dependencies section below.

2. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your data by following the data preprocessing guidelines provided in the project's documentation.

3. **Model Training**: Train the gender and age prediction models using the provided code. Make sure to adjust hyperparameters and model architectures as needed.

4. **Inference**: Use the trained models for inference on your data. You can find sample code and instructions in the project's documentation.

5. **Evaluate and Fine-Tune**: Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune it as necessary to achieve optimal results for your specific use case.

### Usage

The Gender-Age-Prediction project provides a flexible framework for predicting gender and age. To use the project effectively, follow these usage guidelines:

1. **Data Input**: Prepare your data in a format that the model can accept. Refer to the project's documentation for details on data formatting and preprocessing.

2. **Model Inference**: Use the trained models to make predictions on your data. The project's codebase includes functions and scripts for model inference.

3. **Result Analysis**: Analyze the prediction results to gain insights into the gender and age distribution within your dataset.

4. **Customization**: If needed, you can customize the project code to suit your specific requirements, such as using different pre-trained models or modifying the prediction pipeline.
